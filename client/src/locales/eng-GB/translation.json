Upon returning home to Barcelona, he found he was unable to get help even though there were people who wanted to provide it. Telegram and WhatsApp groups were self-organizing in Manuelâ€™s neighborhood, but without personally knowing anyone involved he could not ask them for assistance. Inspired by so many coming together, Manuel launched the project with one mission in mind: to ensure that others could connect in time.",
